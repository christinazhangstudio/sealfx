Didn't find a good way of decoupling env configuration (the client-side ones!)
from the actual build step of this application, which makes K8s envs not great.

This leads us to maintain .env.local for now...

![ts and tsx](ts-vs-tsx.png)

`NEXT_PUBLIC_`: in Next.js, vars exposed to the browser 
(client-side code, like your fetch in useEffect) must start with NEXT_PUBLIC_. 
without this prefix, the var is only available server-side 
(e.g., in getServerSideProps), which doesnâ€™t work for CSR.
